# Backlog

Everything this project has agreed to build and has not built yet. One entry per piece of work,
newest ideas at the bottom, ids never reused.

This file and [`archive.md`](archive.md) are the register. An entry is **moved** between them, whole
— never copied, never deleted. If you cannot find something here, look there.

## The lifecycle of an entry

```
agreed          →  entry lands here, Status: backlog, Plan and Issue empty
planned         →  /fpl:new-feature writes docs/plans/NNN-<slug>.md, Plan filled in
tracked         →  /fpl:track-work opens the issues, Issue filled in
in progress     →  work is happening in the sibling repos
done            →  entry moves to archive.md with its outcome
```

**Status lives in three places and all three must agree**: this entry, the checkboxes in the plan
file, and the parent GitHub issue. Update all three in the session the work lands. A register that
disagrees with itself is worse than no register — the next session believes it.

Nothing is worked on without an entry here. If work starts from a conversation, the entry is written
first, in that conversation.

## Entry format

```markdown
## B-NNN · <short title>
Status   backlog | planned | tracked | in progress
Repos    fpl-backend, fpl-frontend, fpl-orchestrator — whichever it touches
Plan     docs/plans/NNN-<slug>.md, or —
Issue    orchestrator#N (parent), backend#N, frontend#N, or —
Why      What makes this worth building, and anything already established about it that
         should not be re-derived. Facts get a date.
```

## B-001 · FPL authentication

```
Status   backlog
Repos    fpl-backend, fpl-frontend
Plan     —
Issue    —
```

**Why.** `docs/decisions.md` D-007 made auth the app's first screen and removed `FPL_MANAGER_ID`
from the environment, so every downstream feature — squad, projections, optimizer — needs a
signed-in manager id before it can exist. Nothing can be scoped to a user until this lands.

**Already established, probed live 2026-08-26 — do not re-derive.** A conventional
email-and-password sign-in **cannot be built**, four independent ways:

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `dig users.premierleague.com` | no A record — the old login host every FPL tutorial names is gone |
| `account.premierleague.com/as/.well-known/openid-configuration` | `grant_types_supported` has no `password` — ROPC is offered to nobody |
| `/as/authorize` with `redirect_uri=http://localhost:4000/` | `INVALID_VALUE … "Redirect URI mismatch"` — we are not a registered client and cannot become one |
| the sign-in page itself | a PingOne **DaVinci** flow (`/davinci/flows/<id>`) — risk-managed, captcha-capable |

What *is* available, same probes:

- Identity is a PingFederate tenant at `https://account.premierleague.com/as`. The FPL web client's
  public `client_id` is `bfcbaf69-aade-4c1b-8f00-c1cb8a193030`, scope
  `openid profile email offline_access` (read out of `fantasy.premierleague.com/assets/index-*.js`).
- Authenticated FPL calls carry **`X-API-Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`** — not the standard
  `Authorization` header, which the site ignores. The token is also mirrored into an `ACCESS_TOKEN`
  cookie.
- `POST /as/token` with `grant_type=refresh_token` and that `client_id`, **no client secret**,
  returns `invalid_grant: Failed to decode refresh token` for a bogus token — the client
  authenticated fine and only the token was rejected. A refresh token the user's own browser already
  holds is therefore renewable by us indefinitely.
- `GET /api/me/` returns **HTTP 200 with `{"player": null}` when signed out**. Any check that reads
  the status code here passes for every unauthenticated caller.
- `GET /api/my-team/{id}/` returns 403 unauthenticated. It is the only source of pre-deadline bench
  order, chip state, free transfers and true sell values.

**Still open — the mechanism decision, and it is the whole plan.** Roughly: accept a credential
pasted out of the user's own browser (full data, devtools required), accept only a manager id
(public data, no pre-deadline squad, roughly half the build), or offer both. Deferred on
2026-08-26 at the maintainer's direction. When it is picked, record it in `docs/decisions.md` and
replace MAP.md's "Known future surface: writes to FPL" paragraph, which still says cookie handling
needs an explicit decision recorded there.
